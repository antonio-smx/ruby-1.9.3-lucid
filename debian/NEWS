ruby1.9.1 (1.9.2.180-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rubygems executables are now installed to /usr/local/bin, instead of
    /var/lib/gems/1.9.2/bin
  * But the other files created by rubygems stay in /var/lib/gems/1.9.2.
    Several commenters in #448639 and #403407 argued in favor of the switch to
    /usr/local/bin. Those two bugs can therefore be closed. However, the issue
    is not completely solved, as rubygems still installs files in
    /var/lib/gems.
    Nobody in the bug logs explained why that was an issue. If you care about
    it, please open a new bug. Fixes rubygems bugs: #448639, #403407

ruby1.9.1 (1.9.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  $LOAD_PATH is changed in Ruby 1.9.2-p0 as the following (for i386):

    ["/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux"]

  Please note that "." is no longer part of the $LOAD_PATH, so you might need to
  change require statements using relative paths.

ruby1.9 (1.9.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  $LOAD_PATH is changed in Ruby 1.9.1-p0 as the following:

    ["/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/local/lib/site_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/vendor_ruby",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/1.9.1",
     "/usr/lib/ruby1.9/1.9.1/i486-linux",
     "."]

  This changes was introduced by the upstream author. Ruby 1.9.1 may be
  incompatible with older version of Ruby.  So we reject old "i386-linux"
  directory from $LOAD_PATH.

  If you have libraries in old $LOAD_PATH, please rebuild it with this version
  of ruby1.9-dev package.
